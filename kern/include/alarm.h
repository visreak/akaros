 * Alarms.  This includes various ways to sleep for a while or defer work on a
 * specific timer.  These can be per-core, global or whatever.  Deferred work
 * is a function pointer which runs in interrupt context when the alarm goes off
 * (picture running the ksched then).
 *
 * Like with most systems, you won't wake up til after the time you specify (for
 * now).  This might change, esp if we tweak things to coalesce alarms.
 *
 * All tchains come with locks.  Originally, I left these out, since the pcpu
 * tchains didn't need them (disable_irq was sufficient).  However, disabling
 * alarms remotely (a valid use case) is a real pain without locks, so now
 * everyone has locks.  As an added benefit, you can submit an alarm to another
 * core's pcpu tchain (though it probably costs an extra IRQ).  Note there is a
 * lock ordering, tchains before awaiters (when they are grabbed together).
 *
 * There are two options for pcpu alarms: hard IRQ and routine KMSG (RKM).
 * IRQ alarms are run directly in the timer interrupt handler and take a hw_tf
 * parameter in addition to the standard alarm_waiter.  RKM alarms are executed
 * when kernel messages are executed, which is out of IRQ context.  RKMs are
 * safer, since you can sleep (qlock, some kmalloc, etc) and you do not need
 * irqsave locks.
 *
 * Another important difference between IRQ and RKM alarms comes when cancelling
 * or unsetting an alarm.  When you cancel (unset or reset) an alarm, you may
 * need to block until the RKM has run.  IRQ alarms run with the tchain lock
 * held, so once the canceller grabs the lock, it has either run already or will
 * not at all.  With RKMs, the handler runs outside of the lock.  Thus you may
 * have to wait until the RKM has run, and the RKM might be waiting to run on
 * your core.
 *
 * Note that RKM unset_alarm() has a waits-on dependency with the actual alarm
 * handler, so be careful of deadlock.
 *
 * To use an IRQ alarm, init the waiter with init_awaiter_irq().
 *
 * Quick howto, using the pcpu tchains:
 * 	struct timer_chain *tchain = &per_cpu_info[core_id()].tchain;
 * To block your kthread on an alarm:
 * 	struct alarm_waiter *waiter = kmalloc(sizeof(struct alarm_waiter), 0);
 * 	struct alarm_waiter a_waiter;	// or use the stack
 *
 * 	init_awaiter(waiter, HANDLER); // or init_awaiter_irq() for IRQ ctx alarms
 * 	set_awaiter_rel(waiter, USEC);
 * 	set_alarm(tchain, waiter);
 *
 * If you want the HANDLER to run again, do this at the end of it:
 * 	set_awaiter_rel(waiter, USEC);	// or whenever you want it to fire
 * 	set_alarm(tchain, waiter);
 * or:
 * 	reset_alarm_rel(tchain, waiter, USEC);
 *
 * Don't forget to manage your memory at some (safe) point:
 * 	kfree(waiter);
 * In the future, we might have a slab for these.  You can get it from wherever
 * you want, just be careful if you use the stack. */
